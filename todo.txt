- Add a new file, commit it.
- Make another change to that file.
- Revert your project to the point where the file never existed 
  (or just any earlier version). 

To go back:
- Revert to the old version with "git checkout HEAD~1 filename"
  (you can also use "." in place of the filename to revert the whole project!).
- Commit the changes.
